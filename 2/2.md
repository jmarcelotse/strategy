## 1. Personal Introduction
"Hello, my name is José Marcelo. I am a Senior DevSecOps professional with solid experience in cloud solutions architecture, infrastructure automation, and container orchestration. I have more than [X years] of experience working for companies like TIVIT and VERT Capital, leading initiatives focused on security, efficiency, and scalability of infrastructure. My expertise includes CI/CD, Infrastructure as Code (IaC), monitoring, and GitOps strategies, always aiming to enhance developer experience and ensure security across all stages of the application lifecycle."

## 2. Questions and Answers Based on Your Experience
### Question 1: What is your experience with AWS and its related services?
### Answer:

"I have extensive experience with AWS, gained during my time at VERT Capital, where I managed and maintained infrastructure using the following services:

- **EKS**: Orchestrated containerized applications in production, ensuring high availability and scalability.
- **RDS and S3**: Configured databases with RDS and managed object storage with S3, including versioning and integration with other AWS services.
- **Route 53**: Managed DNS to control global traffic routing for applications.
- **IAM**: Implemented security policies and fine-grained access control to protect AWS resources."

### Question 2: Have you worked with infrastructure automation?
### Answer:

"Yes, I have extensive experience in infrastructure automation. During my time at TIVIT and VERT Capital, I used Terraform and Ansible to provision and configure complex environments:

- Using **Terraform**, I created scripts to manage Kubernetes clusters, load balancers, and AWS instances, ensuring consistent and agile provisioning.
- With **Ansible**, I automated server configurations, applied security patches, and optimized the setup of new environments.

This approach reduced manual tasks and minimized configuration errors."

### Question 3: What is your experience with CI/CD pipelines?
### Answer:

"I have extensive experience designing and maintaining CI/CD pipelines (rating: 10), gained from projects using tools like:

- **Jenkins and Bitbucket**: Configured pipelines to automate build, test, and deployment processes for applications, integrating with Kubernetes and using Blue/Green deployment strategies.
- **ArgoCD**: Implemented GitOps to ensure consistent and secure deployments, aligning Git repositories with the desired infrastructure state.
- At TIVIT, I focused on improving developer productivity by automating and standardizing pipelines."

### Question 4: Do you have expertise in monitoring and observability?
### Answer:

"Yes, I have extensive expertise in monitoring and observability, ensuring full visibility into applications and infrastructure:

- **Prometheus and Grafana**: Configured metrics and created custom dashboards to monitor Kubernetes clusters and production applications.
- **Grafana Loki**: Implemented distributed log collection and analysis solutions to identify critical issues.
- **Jaeger**: Configured distributed tracing to map dependencies between microservices and identify performance bottlenecks.

These practices helped reduce incident response time and optimize overall system health."

### Question 5: What is your experience with containers and orchestration?
### Answer:

"I have strong expertise with Docker and Kubernetes, gained during my roles at both TIVIT and VERT Capital:

- **Docker**: Created and managed optimized images used in production environments and CI/CD pipelines.
- **Kubernetes (EKS)**: Deployed and managed Kubernetes clusters on AWS, configured auto-scaling, implemented canary deployments, and managed secrets. Additionally, I used Helm Charts to standardize complex deployments.

My work ensured greater scalability, resilience, and efficiency in managing distributed applications."

### Question 6: How do you incorporate security into DevOps practices?
### Answer:

"My DevSecOps approach integrates security into all stages of the development lifecycle, including:

- **Secure CI/CD**: Configured pipelines with automated validations, such as vulnerability scanning for Docker images and security testing in code before deployment.
- **IAM and security policies**: Ensured fine-grained access controls in AWS and Kubernetes, minimizing risks of unauthorized access.
- **Compliance practices**: Applied frameworks like CIS Benchmarks and configured real-time monitoring for security alerts.

Throughout my experience, I have prioritized security without compromising developer efficiency."

### Question 7: How do you improve the developer experience (DX)?
### Answer:

"At TIVIT, I focused on continuously improving the developer experience (DX) by:

- **Optimizing environments and tools**: Created cloud-based development infrastructures that increased team productivity.
- **Task automation**: Developed CI/CD pipelines that reduced manual tasks, allowing developers to focus on coding.
- **Constant feedback**: Collected developer feedback and adjusted tools and processes to meet the team’s specific needs.

This approach resulted in a more collaborative and efficient working environment for the development team."

### Question 8: How do you handle legacy systems?
### Answer:

"I have experience supporting and modernizing legacy systems. During my time at VERT Capital, I worked on legacy systems while implementing modern practices, such as:

- **Automation**: Used Ansible and Terraform to standardize configurations in legacy environments, improving their consistency.
- **Monitoring**: Set up Zabbix to monitor the health of legacy systems and ensure service continuity during modernization efforts."

### Question 9: Have you worked with GitOps strategies?
### Answer:

"Yes, I implemented GitOps using ArgoCD at VERT Capital. This approach allowed me to:

- Automate deployments directly from Git repositories.
- Ensure consistency in the desired state of the infrastructure.
- Improve traceability and quickly revert changes when necessary.

The implementation of GitOps increased deployment reliability and operational efficiency."

## 3. Closing Statement
"With my practical experience in DevOps and DevSecOps, I am confident in my ability to create scalable, secure, and efficient infrastructures. My expertise in CI/CD, IaC, monitoring, and container orchestration makes me a professional prepared to tackle complex challenges. I am excited about the opportunity to contribute to the team and add value through innovative and secure solutions."
