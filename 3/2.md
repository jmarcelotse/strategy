# Pitch Structure
## 1. Personal Introduction
"Hello, my name is [Your Name]. I am a Senior DevOps Analyst with over [X years] of experience in infrastructure, critical systems maintenance, automation, and SRE practices. I have solid knowledge of monitoring tools like Zabbix, Prometheus, and Grafana, as well as extensive experience designing high-availability architectures using AWS and Kubernetes. I specialize in CI/CD pipelines and deployment strategies such as Canary and Blue/Green, and I am always looking for sustainable solutions to ensure the scalability, resilience, and observability of systems."

## 2. Questions and Answers Based on the Job Description
### Question 1: Do you have experience in maintaining systems and incident management?
### Answer:
"Yes, I have solid experience maintaining production systems and critical applications. I’ve worked extensively in incident management, from proactive detection with monitoring and precise alerts to troubleshooting and resolving issues. I’ve used tools like Zabbix, Prometheus, and AWS CloudWatch to monitor metrics and perform root cause analysis. Additionally, I’ve led post-mortem meetings to identify improvements and prevent future recurrences."

### Question 2: How do you standardize and improve monitoring environments?
### Answer:
"In previous projects, I implemented Prometheus and Grafana as standardized monitoring tools to centralize system observability. I configured clear SLIs and SLOs to create precise alerts and customized dashboards for visualizing critical metrics. I also automated the configuration of these environments using Terraform, which reduced deployment time and ensured consistency across environments."

### Question 3: How do you detect problems and ensure incident predictability?
### Answer:
"I use a proactive approach to problem detection. I configure custom metrics and alerts in tools like Grafana and Prometheus, focusing on critical indicators such as response time and resource usage. I also leverage historical analysis and machine learning integrated into monitoring tools like New Relic to identify patterns and predict potential incidents. In one project, this approach reduced critical production incidents by 35%."

### Question 4: What is your experience with cost analysis in cloud environments?
### Answer:
"I have experience monitoring and optimizing costs across cloud providers like AWS, GCP, and Azure. I use native tools such as AWS Cost Explorer and Azure Cost Management to identify excessive spending and propose optimizations. Recently, I implemented a detailed cost analysis process, optimizing EC2 instances and adjusting auto-scaling policies in Kubernetes, which led to a 20% monthly infrastructure cost reduction."

### Question 5: How do you implement sustainable architectures?
### Answer:
"My implementations focus on scalability, resilience, and automation. For example, in a recent project, I migrated a monolithic application to microservices running on Kubernetes (EKS), using ArgoCD for continuous deployment and Terraform for infrastructure provisioning. This transformation not only reduced operational costs but also improved system availability to 99.99%."

### Question 6: What is your experience with CI/CD pipelines and deployment strategies?
### Answer:
"I have extensive experience with CI/CD pipelines using tools such as Jenkins, GitHub Actions, and Azure DevOps. I’ve implemented deployment strategies like Blue/Green and Canary to ensure safe updates with no downtime. In one case, I used GitOps with ArgoCD to manage deployments on a Kubernetes cluster, optimizing the process and reducing the risk of production failures."

### Question 7: Have you worked with containerization and orchestration (Docker and Kubernetes)?
### Answer:
"Yes, I have advanced experience with Docker for containerization and Kubernetes for orchestration. I’ve worked on Kubernetes clusters in EKS (AWS), configuring auto-scaling, deployments with Helm Charts, and secrets management. In one project, I implemented a microservices architecture that supported high loads, ensuring automated horizontal scalability."

### Question 8: Do you have an AWS certification? What is your experience with AWS services?
### Answer:
"I don’t yet have an AWS certification, but I’m currently preparing for it. However, I have over [X years] of hands-on experience with AWS services, including EC2, RDS, Lambda, S3, and CloudFormation. I’ve configured scalable infrastructures, implemented serverless architectures, and optimized IAM policies for security."

### Question 9: Do you have experience with Terraform and Ansible?
### Answer:
"Yes, I have strong experience with Terraform for infrastructure as code provisioning, such as EC2 instances, EKS clusters, and load balancers. I’ve also used Ansible to automate Linux server configurations, such as dependency installation and security adjustments. This combination ensured consistency and agility in deployment processes."

### Question 10: How do you contribute to the team and share technical knowledge?
### Answer:
"I value collaboration and frequently share knowledge with the team through pair programming, internal workshops, and detailed documentation. In one project, I organized training sessions on Kubernetes and Prometheus for the team, helping to increase team members' autonomy and reduce technical dependencies."

### Question 11: Have you worked with root cause analysis and post-mortem processes?
### Answer:
"Yes, I’ve participated in several root cause analysis processes using tools like ELK Stack and AWS CloudWatch to identify issues in logs and metrics. After resolving incidents, I led post-mortem meetings to document causes, implemented solutions, and preventive actions. This process helped the team reduce recurrences and continuously improve operational processes."

### Question 12: How do you handle changes and adapt to project requirements?
### Answer:
"Adaptation and resilience are part of my day-to-day work. I’ve worked on projects with frequent scope changes, using agile methodologies to quickly adjust priorities. My approach is always to focus on solutions, understanding challenges as opportunities to innovate and add value to the business."

## 3. Closing
"I am very excited about the opportunity to contribute as a Mid-level SRE Analyst, leveraging my experience in system maintenance, automation, and monitoring to implement resilient and sustainable solutions. I believe that my technical skills, combined with my ability to collaborate and adapt, make me a strong candidate for this position."
