## 1. Apresentação Pessoal
"Hello, my name is [Your Name], and I am a Senior DevOps Analyst with over [X years] of experience in cloud infrastructure, automation, and Site Reliability Engineering (SRE). My background includes deep expertise in AWS and Azure environments, Linux and Windows administration, container orchestration with Docker and Kubernetes, and implementing Infrastructure as Code (IAC) with tools like Terraform and Ansible. I am passionate about building scalable, reliable, and secure cloud environments and have a proven track record of improving system resilience and automating deployments."

## 2. Perguntas e Respostas Baseadas na Vaga
### Question 1: Do you have experience maintaining cloud-based Linux and Windows environments?
### Answer:
"Yes, I have extensive experience managing both Linux and Windows environments in cloud platforms like AWS and Azure. I’ve worked on configuring, optimizing, and securing Linux servers for web applications and databases, as well as managing Windows environments for enterprise applications. For instance, I recently implemented a hybrid cloud solution using AWS EC2 and Azure VMs to support multi-platform applications, ensuring high availability and performance."

### Question 2: How do you improve monitoring systems and proactively address issues?
### Answer:
"I improve monitoring systems by integrating tools like AWS CloudWatch, ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana), and Prometheus to track key metrics and set up real-time alerts. For example, in one project, I configured Prometheus to monitor application performance and created custom Grafana dashboards for better visibility. I also implemented proactive alerting for CPU and memory usage, reducing incident response time by 40%. Additionally, I use historical metrics and patterns to anticipate potential issues and take preventive action."

### Question 3: Can you describe your experience with Terraform and Ansible for automation?
### Answer:
"I have significant experience with both Terraform and Ansible. I’ve used Terraform to provision and manage infrastructure in AWS, such as EC2 instances, S3 buckets, and RDS databases. I also automated configurations and deployments using Ansible, streamlining tasks like server provisioning, package installation, and security patches. In one project, I built a Terraform script to deploy a Kubernetes cluster on EKS, reducing setup time from days to hours."

### Question 4: How do you implement security best practices in cloud environments?
### Answer:
"I prioritize security by implementing IAM roles with least privilege, encrypting data at rest and in transit, and using tools like AWS Secrets Manager for secure credential management. For compliance, I follow frameworks like CIS Benchmarks and perform regular vulnerability scans. In one project, I secured an Azure environment by setting up network security groups, enabling Azure Security Center, and automating vulnerability remediation through Ansible."

### Question 5: Do you have experience troubleshooting and resolving incidents?
### Answer:
"Yes, I have extensive experience in troubleshooting and resolving incidents in production environments. I follow a structured process that includes analyzing logs with ELK Stack, pinpointing root causes, and implementing immediate fixes to minimize downtime. For example, I once resolved a critical incident in a Kubernetes environment where an incorrect Helm deployment caused service outages. By rolling back the deployment and fixing the configuration, I restored service in under 30 minutes."

### Question 6: What is your experience with CI/CD pipelines?
### Answer:
"I’ve designed and managed CI/CD pipelines using tools like Jenkins, GitHub Actions, and AWS CodePipeline. I implement pipelines to automate build, test, and deployment processes, ensuring code is consistently delivered to production. In a recent project, I configured Jenkins pipelines for a microservices architecture, deploying Docker containers to Kubernetes using a Blue/Green deployment strategy, which minimized risks during updates."

### Question 7: Have you worked with cloud networking concepts like VPNs and transit gateways?
### Answer:
"Yes, I have experience configuring and managing cloud networking solutions. I’ve set up VPNs for secure communication between on-premises environments and AWS, as well as configured Transit Gateways to connect multiple VPCs. For example, I created a hybrid architecture where an AWS environment communicated with on-premise databases via a Site-to-Site VPN, ensuring low latency and secure data transfer."

### Question 8: Can you share your experience with Docker and Kubernetes?
### Answer:
"I have extensive experience with Docker for containerizing applications and Kubernetes for orchestrating containers. I’ve worked on deploying and managing Kubernetes clusters in AWS EKS, configuring auto-scaling, and creating Helm charts for deployments. In a recent project, I migrated a monolithic application to a microservices architecture using Docker and Kubernetes, significantly improving scalability and fault tolerance."

### Question 9: How do you handle root cause analysis and post-incident reviews?
### Answer:
"I follow a detailed process for root cause analysis (RCA), using tools like ELK Stack and CloudWatch to investigate logs and metrics. After identifying the root cause, I document findings and conduct post-incident reviews with the team to discuss lessons learned and implement preventive measures. For example, after a database outage caused by high IOPS usage, I optimized queries and configured RDS auto-scaling to prevent future occurrences."

### Question 10: How do you collaborate with teams to improve reliability and resilience?
### Answer:
"Collaboration is key in my role. I work closely with development, QA, and operations teams to identify bottlenecks and improve system resilience. For example, I collaborated with developers to refactor code for better resource utilization and implemented canary deployments to test changes in production safely. I also regularly share knowledge with team members through workshops and documentation to ensure everyone is aligned."

### Question 11: What scripting languages do you use, and how do you apply them?
### Answer:
"I have experience with Python, Bash, and Powershell for automating tasks and creating custom scripts. For example, I used Python to automate the analysis of CloudWatch metrics, generating daily reports on resource usage. I also use Bash scripts to manage Linux environments, such as automating log rotation and backup processes, and Powershell for managing Windows servers."

### Question 12: How do you handle on-call rotations and incident response?
### Answer:
"I have experience participating in on-call rotations and am comfortable responding to incidents promptly. My focus is on minimizing service disruption by quickly identifying and resolving the issue. For example, during an on-call shift, I resolved a Kubernetes pod scaling issue caused by misconfigured resource limits, restoring system stability in under 20 minutes."

## 3. Closing Statement
"I am very excited about the opportunity to join Kanda Software as a Senior DevOps/SRE. With my extensive experience in cloud platforms, automation, and incident management, I am confident in my ability to build scalable and resilient systems. I look forward to contributing to the team and driving improvements in infrastructure reliability and performance."
